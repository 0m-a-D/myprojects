Aim: Object Detection Model in Rust

Architecture: CNN (Convolution Neural Network)

Activation function: ReLu (R(x) = max(0,x))

Model involves:
  -> building layers (Convolution and Pooling layers for feature extraction)
  -> flattening of "resultant" from Pooling
  -> building a "fully connected layer" for performing regression and classification for vehicle detection
  -> choosing appropriate activation functions for convolution and FCL (fully connected layer)
