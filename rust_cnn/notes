This CNN supports following architecture:

-> convolution layer, max pooling for pooling layer, fully connected layers (dense layers)
-> optimizers: Adam, SGD, Momentum, RMSProp
-> cross-entropy loss function (for classification) and MSE (for regression)
-> activation functions: ReLu (for regression) and SoftMax (for classification): COMPLETED
-> Dropout
-> He Initialization
